the big picture behind the algorithms is computation? to reduse time and space.

and that is why it is considered to be one of the main components of distributed computation

what are the comutation types?
1- Single   instruction streem and Single data streem,
2- Single   instruction streem and Multiple data streem,----> these two should have the sync clock
3- Multiple instruction streem and Single data streem,  __|
4- Multiple instruction streem and Multiple data streem,

what are the things that ITS 350 does not have the answer?

1- reliability.
2- performance/ ratio
3- geographical?
4- Distributed resource, people, and ...
5- scalability->this is the concerns it self with the number of users of the system.

Distributed vs Divided computation:-
Divided Computation has been achieved in many ways
it was achieved with having multiple cpus and connecting them by PCIe to the memory, and exchanging data using the that interconnection which is PCI express.
or or they can have multi core processing units and threads.

However, in distributed computing you will have multiple computers and you will connect them by modern technology, i.e connecting 2 or more computers, by rj-45 or a fiber-cable, or or wirelessly.
