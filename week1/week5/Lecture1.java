     *Today there will not be any applications ;(
     * today We will create a model for distributed computing, this model will be abstract and you may work with java,
     * or any other program.
     *
     * A distributed application model
     *  will have to show you how the distributed execution is happening
     * okay, coll :)
     * in distributed computing we have a process that is connecting to another process. (may be not calling it a NODE is better)
     *
     *
     * the facts about the processes and the channels
     * 1- you cann't predict the behavior of the channel
     * 2- they are asynchronous
     * 3- each process has it is needs , and limited resources
     * 4- and each process is independent and has it is own local memory, so they have there local state.
     * 5- also each channel has it is state, so it might be used, or be down
